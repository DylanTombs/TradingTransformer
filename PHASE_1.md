# Phase 1 — Correctness & Data Integrity

**Status:** Not Started  
**Prerequisites:** None  
**Unlocks:** Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4

---

## Objective

Make every reported result trustworthy and every component tested. Phase 1 is the foundation gate: no subsequent phase can produce valid conclusions if the underlying system has silent bugs, untested components, or results computed against an outdated execution model.

**Exit criteria (all must be satisfied before Phase 1 is closed):**
- [ ] Zero `xfail` markers in `pytest` output
- [ ] Python test coverage ≥ 80% (`pytest --cov`)
- [ ] C++ test coverage ≥ 80% (GCov/LCov report from `ctest`)
- [ ] All invalid `backtest_config.yaml` inputs caught with clear error messages (schema validation test suite passes)
- [ ] README results table updated to reflect current slippage + risk-sizing model
- [ ] CI pipeline reports coverage on every push
- [ ] All tasks in this document marked complete

## Task Breakdown

### 1.1 Fix Ticker-Boundary Data Leakage (B-01)

**File:** `research/transformer/DataFrame.py`  
**Issue:** `DataFrameDataset` uses a single flat index for sliding windows across all symbols. A window of size 30 can start at the last bar of symbol A and end at the first bar of symbol B. This mixes temporal contexts across fundamentally different assets, contaminating the model's learned representations.  
**Current state:** Marked `xfail` in `tests/test_dataset.py`.

**Required change:**
- Track per-symbol boundary indices in `DataFrameDataset.__init__`.
- During window generation, reject any window whose start and end indices cross a symbol boundary.
- If `seqLen` (30) exceeds the length of a symbol's data, skip that symbol with a logged warning rather than producing partial windows.

**Test requirement:**
- Remove `xfail` marker from `test_dataset.py::test_ticker_boundary_leakage`.
- Add assertion: no window's feature rows contain data from more than one symbol.
- Add edge case: symbol with fewer than `seqLen` bars is excluded without crash.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `pytest tests/test_dataset.py` passes with zero `xfail` or `xpass`.
- Dataset produces `N - seqLen` windows per symbol (where N = symbol bar count) with no cross-symbol contamination.

### 1.2 Add Date-Gap Detection to FeatureCSVDataHandler (B-02)

**File:** `backtester/src/market/FeatureCSVDataHandler.cpp`  
**File:** `backtester/include/market/FeatureCSVDataHandler.hpp`  
**Issue:** The handler reads CSV rows sequentially without checking whether consecutive timestamps are separated by more than one trading day. Non-adjacent bars (weekends, halts, missing data) are treated as adjacent by `MLStrategy`'s rolling feature buffer, producing incorrect time-mark encoding (month/day/weekday features become inconsistent).

**Required change:**
- After parsing each row, compare its timestamp to the previous row's timestamp.
- If the gap exceeds one calendar day (accounting for weekends: Saturday/Sunday skips are ≤ 3 days; any gap > 3 days is anomalous), emit a warning log with symbol, expected timestamp, and actual timestamp.
- Add a `gapCount_` field to `FeatureCSVDataHandler` that accumulates the number of anomalous gaps detected; expose via a `gapCount()` accessor.
- This is a warning, not an error — do not halt the backtest.

**Test requirement (new file: `backtester/tests/test_data_handler.cpp`):**
- Normal adjacent bars: no warnings emitted, `gapCount() == 0`.
- Weekend skip (Friday → Monday): no warning (≤ 3 day gap).
- Missing bars (Friday → Wednesday): warning emitted, `gapCount() == 1`.
- CSV with all required columns loads correctly.
- CSV with missing columns throws a clear exception at construction.
- CSV with wrong column count throws at construction, not silently at first inference.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `test_data_handler.cpp` compiles and passes as part of `ctest`.
- A backtest run against a CSV with a known gap logs a warning containing the gap start timestamp.

### 1.3 Config Schema Validation — Python Layer (TD-06)

**File:** `run_pipeline.py`, `research/features/pipeline.py`, `research/training/Interface.py`  
**Issue:** No validation of training configuration inputs. Bad values (negative `seqLen`, `predLen > seqLen`, non-existent data paths) are only caught at runtime deep in the training loop.

**Required change:**
- Add a `PipelineConfig` Pydantic model (or `dataclasses` + manual validators) that covers all training hyperparameters.
- Validate at the entry point of `run_pipeline.py` before any file I/O or model operations begin.
- Error messages must name the invalid field and its expected range or type.

**Fields to validate:**
```python
class PipelineConfig(BaseModel):
    seq_len: int       # > 0, typically 20–100
    label_len: int     # >= 0, <= seq_len
    pred_len: int      # > 0, typically 1–10
    d_model: int       # > 0, power of 2 recommended
    n_heads: int       # > 0, must divide d_model evenly
    e_layers: int      # > 0
    d_layers: int      # > 0
    d_ff: int          # > 0
    dropout: float     # 0.0 <= dropout < 1.0
    batch_size: int    # > 0
    train_epochs: int  # > 0
    learning_rate: float  # > 0.0
    data_path: str     # must exist on filesystem
```

**Test requirement:**
- Unit tests for each field: valid input passes, each invalid input raises `ValidationError` with the field name in the message.
- Integration test: `run_pipeline.py --config bad_config.yaml` exits with code 1 and a human-readable error.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Passing an invalid config exits immediately with `[CONFIG ERROR] <field>: <reason>` before any model or file operations.

---

### 1.4 Config Schema Validation — C++ Layer (TD-06)

**File:** `backtester/include/config/BacktestConfig.hpp`  
**Issue:** `BacktestConfig::loadFromYAML()` silently applies defaults for missing or mistyped fields. A misconfigured `risk_fraction: "ten_percent"` or negative `initial_cash` produces a silently broken backtest.

**Required change:**
- After loading the YAML, validate all numeric fields against documented constraints.
- Throw `std::invalid_argument` with a message naming the field and the violated constraint.
- Fields and constraints:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|-----------|
| `initial_cash` | > 0.0 |
| `risk_fraction` | 0.0 < x ≤ 1.0 |
| `max_symbol_exposure` | 0.0 < x ≤ 1.0 |
| `max_total_exposure` | 0.0 < x ≤ 1.0 |
| `max_position_size` | > 0 |
| `half_spread` | >= 0.0 |
| `slippage_fraction` | >= 0.0 |
| `market_impact` | >= 0.0 |
| `commission` | >= 0.0 |
| `correlation_window` | > 0 |
| `correlation_threshold` | 0.0 <= x <= 1.0 |
| `model_pt` path | file must exist |
| `feature_scaler_csv` path | file must exist |
| `target_scaler_csv` path | file must exist |

**Test requirement (add to existing `test_engine.cpp` or new `test_config.cpp`):**
- Valid config loads without exception.
- Each invalid field produces an exception with the field name in the message.
- Missing model file path produces an exception at load time, not at inference time.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Running `./ml_backtest bad_config.yaml` exits immediately with `[CONFIG] invalid_field: constraint_violated` before any data is loaded.

### 1.5 Fill C++ Test Coverage Gaps (TD-02, TD-03, TD-04, TD-05)

Four components currently have zero dedicated unit tests. Each must have a new test file or added test cases.

#### 1.5.1 SimulatedExecution (TD-02)

**New file:** `backtester/tests/test_execution.cpp`

Tests required:
- BUY fill price = `price × (1 + halfSpread + slippage) + impact × qty` within floating point tolerance.
- SELL fill price = `price × (1 - halfSpread - slippage) - impact × qty`.
- Commission deducted from fill regardless of direction.
- Zero slippage, zero spread, zero impact: fill price equals raw price.
- Market impact scales linearly with quantity.
- All-zero execution params: fill at exact price with exact commission.

#### 1.5.2 PerformanceMetrics (TD-03)

**New file:** `backtester/tests/test_metrics.cpp`

Tests required:
- Flat equity curve: Sharpe = 0, drawdown = 0, return = 0.
- Monotonically increasing equity: positive Sharpe, zero drawdown.
- Known drawdown (equity peak at bar 5, trough at bar 10): `maxDrawdown` matches hand-computed value.
- Sharpe formula matches reference: construct equity curve where daily return = 0.001 ± 0.0 stddev → Sharpe approaches infinity (clamp check).
- Bessel correction: `n` vs `n-1` denominator test with short series (< 30 bars).
- Alpha = strategy return - benchmark return: verify with identical equity curves (alpha = 0).
- Information Ratio with benchmark that matches strategy (IR = 0).

#### 1.5.3 FeatureCSVDataHandler (TD-04)

**New file:** `backtester/tests/test_data_handler.cpp` (merged with 1.2)

Tests required:
- Correct number of events emitted for a known CSV (N rows → N events after warmup).
- Feature vector size is exactly 34 per event.
- Timestamps preserved correctly in emitted events.
- Prices (open, high, low, close) parsed correctly.
- CSV with wrong column count throws at construction.
- Empty CSV produces zero events without crash.
- Single-row CSV produces zero events (fewer than `seqLen` bars).

#### 1.5.4 MultiAssetDataHandler (TD-05)

**New tests in:** `backtester/tests/test_engine.cpp` or new `test_multi_asset.cpp`

Tests required:
- Two symbols with identical timestamps: both events emitted on same `streamNext()` call.
- Two symbols with non-overlapping timestamps: each symbol emits independently.
- Symbol A exhausted, symbol B continues: engine keeps running until both exhausted.
- Three symbols where one has a missing bar: missing bar skipped, other two synchronised.
- All symbols exhausted: `streamNext()` adds nothing to queue, engine terminates.

### 1.6 Upgrade CI Pipeline (TD-01, TD-10)

**Files:** `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`

#### 1.6.1 Python: Enable Coverage Reporting

Add to `python-app.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Test with coverage
  run: pytest tests/ -v --cov=research --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80

- name: Upload coverage report
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
```

Add `pytest-cov` to `requirements.txt`.

#### 1.6.2 Python: Enable Full Flake8 Style Checking

Replace current syntax-only check with:
```yaml
- name: Lint
  run: |
    flake8 research/ tests/ scripts/ run_pipeline.py \
      --max-line-length=100 \
      --extend-ignore=E203,W503
```

Fix all existing style violations before enabling (do not add `# noqa` suppression without comment).

#### 1.6.3 C++: Enable Coverage Reporting

Add to `build.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Configure with coverage
  run: cmake -S backtester -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON

- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
    ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
    gcov -r build/CMakeFiles/...

- name: Generate lcov report
  run: |
    lcov --capture --directory build --output-file coverage.info
    lcov --remove coverage.info '/usr/*' --output-file coverage.info
    genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage_html
```

Add `ENABLE_COVERAGE` CMake option that adds `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage` flags.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Every PR shows coverage delta in CI output.
- Build fails if Python coverage drops below 80%.

### 1.7 Update README Results Table (B-03)

After all above tasks are complete and passing:

1. Re-run the full pipeline end-to-end on all five benchmark symbols (BX, KDP, PEP, ASML, UNH) using the current execution model:
   - `half_spread: 0.0005`
   - `slippage_fraction: 0.0005`
   - `market_impact: 0.0`
   - `commission: 1.0`
   - `risk_fraction: 0.10`
2. Update the results table in `README.md` with the new metrics.
3. Add a note under the table: `"Results computed with slippage model v2 (half-spread 0.05%, slippage 0.05%, commission $1.00, risk fraction 10%). Config: backtest_config.yaml."`.
4. Remove the existing disclaimer `"Results were produced before the slippage model..."`.
